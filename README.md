# citygml-roof-segment-labels

Generate datasets of roof segment labels for aerial imagery derived from CityGML semantic 3D city models for semantic segmentation as described in [1].


## Overview

The notebook _dataset\_creation.ipynb_ provides steps and detailed instructions for the dataset creation (data pre-processing, generation of image and label files, data split). The roof segment geometries for all configurations are available in the subdirectory _segments_. The locations selected for validation and test sets are located in _val\_test\_locations_. To create custom datasets using the code provided here, make sure your data is structured identically to the data in these subdirectories.

The roof segment geometries for the configuration _small-manu_ are sourced from [2].
